# Attack Monitoring Guide - How to Track When Attackers Are Active

## üéØ Quick Reference: Attack Indicators

### 1. **POISONING ROUND Markers**
The most obvious indicator that an attack is happening:
```
INFO     ============================== POISONING ROUND: 2004 ==============================
```

**Meaning:** This round includes malicious clients training with poisoned data.

### 2. **Malicious Client Selection**
Shows which clients are malicious vs benign in each poisoning round:
```
INFO     ClientManager: Selected clients
INFO          <class 'backfed.clients.neurotoxin_malicious_client.NeurotoxinClient'>: [13, 61]
             <class 'backfed.clients.base_benign_client.BenignClient'>: [32, 15, 18, ...]
```

**Interpretation:**
- `NeurotoxinClient`: Malicious clients (performing attack)
- `BenignClient`: Honest clients (normal training)

### 3. **Poison Module Updates**
Indicates when malicious clients update their attack strategy:
```
Client [13] (neurotoxin_malicious) at round 2004 - Poison module updated
```

**Meaning:** The attacker has synchronized with other malicious clients and updated their poison pattern.

### 4. **Attack Success Metrics**
Monitor these to see if the attack is working:

**Backdoor Accuracy** (most important):
```
test_backdoor_acc: 90.62% (8156/9000)  ‚Üê Attack is SUCCESSFUL
test_backdoor_acc: 1.23% (111/9000)    ‚Üê Attack is WEAK/FAILED
test_backdoor_acc: 0.00% (0/9000)      ‚Üê Attack has NO EFFECT
```

**Clean Accuracy** (should remain high):
```
test_clean_acc: 82.80% (8280/10000)    ‚Üê Model still works normally
test_clean_acc: 30.33% (3033/10000)    ‚Üê Model degraded (attack too aggressive)
```

**Weight Difference Norms:**
```
Client 13 has weight diff norm 0.2037  ‚Üê Malicious (very small update)
Client 32 has weight diff norm 6.9133  ‚Üê Benign (normal update)
```

**Pattern:** Neurotoxin attackers typically have **much smaller** weight updates due to gradient masking.

## üìä Attack Timeline Example

From a real experiment (slurm-7891763.out):

### Round 2001-2003: Pre-Attack
```
Round 2001: test_backdoor_acc: 0.00%  ‚Üê No attack yet
Round 2002: test_backdoor_acc: 0.00%  ‚Üê No attack yet
Round 2003: test_backdoor_acc: 100.00% ‚Üê Random spike (not real attack)
```

### Round 2004: First Poisoning Round
```
INFO ============================== POISONING ROUND: 2004 ==============================
Client [13] (neurotoxin_malicious) - Training time: 2.05s
Client [61] (neurotoxin_malicious) - Training time: 2.24s
Round 2004: test_backdoor_acc: 0.00%  ‚Üê Attack started but not effective yet
```

### Round 2010-2018: Sustained Attack
```
Round 2010: POISONING ROUND - Client [0] poison module updated
Round 2011: POISONING ROUND  
Round 2012: POISONING ROUND - Client [4] poison module updated
Round 2013: POISONING ROUND - Client [4] poison module updated
Round 2014: POISONING ROUND
...
Backdoor accuracy fluctuating: 0-4% (weak attack due to gradient_mask_ratio=0.1)
```

## üîç Command-Line Monitoring Tools

### 1. **Track All Poisoning Rounds**
```bash
grep "POISONING ROUND" slurm-*.out
```

**Output:**
```
INFO ============================== POISONING ROUND: 2004 ==============================
INFO ============================== POISONING ROUND: 2007 ==============================
INFO ============================== POISONING ROUND: 2008 ==============================
```

### 2. **See Which Malicious Clients Trained**
```bash
grep "neurotoxin_malicious.*Training time" slurm-*.out | head -20
```

**Output:**
```
Client [13] (neurotoxin_malicious) - Training time: 2.05s | RAM: 1.85GB | VRAM: 0.07GB
Client [61] (neurotoxin_malicious) - Training time: 2.24s | RAM: 1.87GB | VRAM: 0.07GB
```

### 3. **Track Backdoor Accuracy Over Time**
```bash
grep "test_backdoor_acc" slurm-*.out
```

**Output:**
```
test_backdoor_acc: 0.00% (0/9000)
test_backdoor_acc: 100.00% (9000/9000)
test_backdoor_acc: 90.62% (8156/9000)
test_backdoor_acc: 1.23% (111/9000)
```

### 4. **See Malicious Client Selection Per Round**
```bash
grep -A 5 "POISONING ROUND" slurm-*.out | grep "NeurotoxinClient"
```

**Output:**
```
'backfed.clients.neurotoxin_malicious_client.NeurotoxinClient'>: [13, 61]
'backfed.clients.neurotoxin_malicious_client.NeurotoxinClient'>: [13]
```

### 5. **Monitor Weight Difference Norms (Attack Strength)**
```bash
grep "Client .* has weight diff norm" slurm-*.out | grep -A 2 "POISONING ROUND"
```

### 6. **Real-Time Monitoring**
```bash
tail -f slurm-*.out | grep -E "POISONING ROUND|backdoor_acc|neurotoxin"
```

- **Attack should be visible** in poisoning rounds
- **Weight diff norms** for malicious clients: 3-10
- **Clean accuracy** should remain high: 75-85%
