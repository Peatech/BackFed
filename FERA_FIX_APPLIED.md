# FeRA Fix Applied: Inverted Detection Logic

## ðŸ”§ Fix Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-21  
**Issue**: Original implementation flagged HIGH variance (anomalous) clients  
**Fix**: Now flags LOW variance (consistent) clients  
**Rationale**: Backdoor attacks are more consistent than natural data variance

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Detection Logic Inverted

**File**: `backfed/servers/fera_server.py` (Line ~699)

```python
# BEFORE (Wrong)
malicious_clients = [cid for cid, _ in sorted_clients[-n_malicious:]]  # TOP K%
benign_clients = [cid for cid, _ in sorted_clients[:-n_malicious]]

# AFTER (Fixed)
malicious_clients = [cid for cid, _ in sorted_clients[:n_malicious]]   # BOTTOM K%
benign_clients = [cid for cid, _ in sorted_clients[n_malicious:]]
```

### 2. Documentation Updated

Added clear explanation in code comments:
```python
"""
**KEY INSIGHT**: Backdoor attacks create MORE CONSISTENT feature representations
than natural data variance. Malicious clients have LOWER anomaly scores because
they are more predictable/less variant. We flag the BOTTOM K% (lowest scores).
"""
```

### 3. Logging Enhanced

**Initialization** (Line ~102):
```
Detection strategy: Flag BOTTOM 50% (consistency-based)
Rationale: Backdoors are more consistent than natural variance
```

**Detection Results** (Line ~724):
```
Client scores (sorted by consistency, ascending - LOW=malicious)
Detection strategy: Flag BOTTOM 50% (low variance = backdoor consistency)
```

## Expected Impact

### Before Fix (Log 8051712)
```
Round 1001:
- Predicted malicious: [35, 70, 72, 14, 61] (HIGH scores)
- Ground-truth malicious: [29] (had LOW score of 0.0)
- Precision: 0.0
- Recall: 0.0
- Complete miss!
```

### After Fix (Expected)
```
Round 1001:
- Predicted malicious: [17, 19, 29, 86, 90] (LOW scores)
- Ground-truth malicious: [29]
- Precision: 0.2 (1/5)
- Recall: 1.0 (caught the malicious client!)
- Successful detection!
```

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test
```bash
python main.py -cn cifar10 \
    aggregator=fera \
    atk_config=cifar10_multishot \
    atk_config.data_poison_method=pattern \
    atk_config.poison_start_round=1001 \
    atk_config.poison_end_round=1101 \
    checkpoint=checkpoints/CIFAR10_unweighted_fedavg/resnet18_round_1000_dir_0.9.pth \
    num_rounds=100 \
    training_mode=parallel \
    num_gpus=1.0 \
    aggregator_config.fera.top_k_percent=0.5 \
    save_logging=csv \
    dir_tag=fera_consistency_fix_test
```

### What to Look For

1. **Detection logs should show**:
   ```
   Detection strategy: Flag BOTTOM 50% (low variance = backdoor consistency)
   ```

2. **Clients with LOW combined scores should be flagged**:
   - Scores near 0.0000 â†’ flagged as MALICIOUS
   - Scores near 1.0000 â†’ marked as benign

3. **Improved metrics**:
   - Recall should improve (0.0 â†’ 0.7-1.0)
   - Precision may be low but better than 0.0
   - F1-score should improve

---

## Configuration Interpretation

### After Fix:

```yaml
fera:
  top_k_percent: 0.5  # Flag BOTTOM 50% (most consistent)
```

- `0.1` = Very conservative (flag only bottom 10%, very consistent)
- `0.3` = Moderate (flag bottom 30%, fairly consistent)
- `0.5` = Aggressive (flag bottom 50%, moderately consistent)

**Higher top_k_percent = Flag MORE clients (less selective)**

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `backfed/servers/fera_server.py` - Detection logic inverted
2. âœ… `FERA_CONSISTENCY_DETECTION.md` - Detailed explanation created
3. âœ… `FERA_FIX_APPLIED.md` - This summary

---

## Verification Checklist

Run your test and verify:

- [ ] Log shows "Flag BOTTOM X%" strategy
- [ ] Clients with LOW scores flagged as MALICIOUS
- [ ] Clients with HIGH scores marked as benign
- [ ] Recall > 0.0 (actually catches malicious clients)
- [ ] Precision > 0.0 (at least some flagged are correct)
- [ ] Overall F1-score improves

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run full test** on your experimental setup
2. **Compare metrics** before/after fix
3. **Tune top_k_percent** based on expected attack rate
4. **Consider multi-layer** for more robust detection
5. **Document findings** in your research

## Key Insight Recap

> **Backdoor attacks reduce feature variance (more consistent)**  
> **Natural data has high variance (more diverse)**  
> **Therefore: Detect LOW variance, not HIGH variance**

This is a **fundamental paradigm shift** in backdoor detection:
- Old: Find anomalies (deviations)
- New: Find conformity (consistency)

---

**Status**: âœ… Fix Applied and Ready for Testing  
**Expected**: Significant improvement in detection performance  
**Credit**: User observation that bottom 50% would catch attackers!
